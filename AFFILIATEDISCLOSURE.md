<h1>Affiliate Disclosure</h1>

This repository uses affiliate programs for monetization or store credit, which means when you click on links to various sites that I recommend in my posts and make a purchase, this can result in a small commission that is credited to me.  Prices are exactly the same for you if your purchase is through an affiliate link or a non-affiliate link. You will not pay more by clicking through to the link.
Some affiliate programs and affiliations include, but are not limited to, Amazon.de.

**I have chosen to only recommend products in our articles that I use myself.
Any compensation received will never influence the content, topics or posts made.**

The owner is not compensated to provide opinion on products, services, websites and various other topics unless disclosed. The views and opinions expressed here are purely my own. If I claim or appear to be expert on a certain topic or product or service area, I will only endorse products or services that I believe, based on my expertise, are worthy of such endorsement. Any product claim, statistic, quote or other representation about a product or service should be verified with the manufacturer or provider.



**Thank you** for supporting me through the use of affiliate links.  This encourages me to continue to make the best content we can and share it with the community.
